## Software Engineering Immersive
`2021-2022` [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)

Having been programming as a hobby since elementary school, and working in IT for over a decade at the time, the software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly came at the perfect time in my development journey. It helped me rapidly bridge the gap between my self-taught programming foundation and modern web development practices, particularly valuable as it positioned me perfectly for the emergence of AI-assisted development:

- **Modern Tech Integration**: The bootcamp helped formalize and modernize my existing programming knowledge, introducing me to current web development technologies and best practices right before OpenAI APIs became widely available
- **Enhanced Not Dependent**: My long programming background combined with formal training means I can work effectively with or without AI tools, using them to enhance rather than replace core development skills
- **Full-Stack Perspective**: Comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend, building on years of programming experience to effectively leverage AI tools across the entire development stack
- **Problem-Solving Synthesis**: Combining years of self-taught programming creativity with structured bootcamp methodologies, essential for crafting effective AI prompts and solutions
- **Collaborative Development**: Experience with pair programming and team projects, valuable for modern AI-augmented development workflows
